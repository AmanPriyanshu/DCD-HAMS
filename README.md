Medical analysis has become an integral part of modern society. With the advent of modern transport and better locomotive capacity, the world was introduced to faster methods of travel, however, with it came the risk of widespread spread of disease, such as in the case of pandemics.

It becomes important to study the initial symptoms of such diseases and develop a better understanding of the disease itself.
